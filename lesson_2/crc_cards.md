# CRC Cards

Class Responsibility Cards (CRC) is a way to model the various classes of a program.

It started as a teaching tool, but is now a real world tool to flesh out and design classes and map interactions between classes.

We draw CRC cards are part of brainstorming.

CRC cards contain class name, responsibilities, and collaborators.

Feel free to use CRC cards, but in general you should:

1. Write a description of the problem and extract major nouns and verbs.
2. Make an initial guess at organizing the verbs and nouns into methods and classes/modules, then do a spike to explore the problem with temporary code.
3. When you have a better idea of the problem, model your thoughts into CRC cards.
